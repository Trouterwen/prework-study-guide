# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

This is a Prework study guide webpage I built in order to help me better understand the topics i will be covering in this bootcamp course. Those topics include CSS, HTML, JavaScript, CLI commands, and Git Commands. It gave me the tools and insight to fix the problems i may run into in the real world. Wanting to learn the ins and outs of each of the topics gave me the motivation to make this project because i know these things are used everyday in daily lives.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
